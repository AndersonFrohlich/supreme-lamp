Hi there,

I was looking for some interesting jobs and find your needs,
I'm a portuguese native portuguese speakar and I lived in Brasil for
around 20 years, unfortunately I have no many experiences with translation 
jobs, but I'm pretty sure of that I can translate these for you  and 
I will be glad to help you with this service, please send me some 
specification of the translation topics if have, I will be happy hearing 
from you, all the best

Kind regards,
Anderson Frohlich
